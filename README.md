# Code Helper 101

![alt text](code-helper-101-sm.png)

A powerful VSCode extension that provides AI-powered code assistance similar to GitHub Copilot, but with enterprise-grade API support and custom certificate handling. Perfect for organizations requiring secure, self-hosted, or custom AI solutions.

This extension automatically works with your exsitin certificates so it will send the certificates to the AI endpoint of your choosing ( i.e. Enterprise endpoint).

We are working on a few new agentic features that will be hopefully released very soon.
